# Solsystem

## Background

This project was [an ungraded obligatory assignment](https://github.com/Iannen/Solsystem/blob/main/Assignment%202.pdf) at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) for the course 'DAT154 Software Architecture and Application Development', and was written in the spring of 2024.

## The App

The app is a .NET solution consisting of two projects:
- 'Library' reads an excel file to get raw data about the members of a solar system, and contains logic for calculating positions and similar
- 'GraphicalWPF' Uses the library as a model and creates a 2D representation of the system. It has some sliders to adjust scale, FPS and a timescale factor.
